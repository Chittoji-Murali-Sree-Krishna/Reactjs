# portfolio
>this is my portfolio
- for routing i used
```javascript
import {BrowserRouter as Router, Switch, Route} from 'react-router-dom';
```
# todoapp
>this is a simple to app
- i used prevent default so that the app wont refresh each and everytime when we click add, if it refresh we loose a have a blank page becase there is no database connected to it
```javascript
event.preventDefault();
```
